# An Automated Snakemake Pipeline for Detecting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Genes
This project provides an automated Snakemake-based pipeline designed to streamline the detection and analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from genomic sequencing data. It facilitates the integration of bioinformatics tools and resources to efficiently process large datasets, particularly those derived from public repositories, such as NCBI. The pipeline supports researchers working on AMR-related studies by automating tasks and ensuring reproducibility across different computing environments.
